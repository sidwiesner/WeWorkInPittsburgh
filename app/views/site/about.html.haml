%p= SETTINGS['organization']['name'] + " is a community edited guide to the People, Companies, Groups, Projects, Products, and Resources that make up the creative, technology, and business community in Pittsburgh. It was launched by Sid Wiesner and Brad Wyland in February 2013, but continues to grow and thrive because of people like you!"

%h2 What does it mean to be "community edited"?

%p This guide is being developed on ideas that helped <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, and other communities grow organically. These are networks built on a trust that provides checks and balances, influenced by a set of core values.

%p Most guides are curated by an individual. This guide is different.

%p When you join using <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> (perhaps more soon), you create a person profile. Only you can edit or delete this profile. Once you are logged in, you can add other people from your Twitter/LinkedIn networks, as well as add Companies, Groups, Projects, Products, and Resources.

%p The fun comes when you realize that anybody who is logged in can add anything - but can also change or take anything away. This network requires trust in a system where anybody can change or remove a non-human profile, but anybody can change or add it back as well.

%p Thanks Pittsburgh, <br/>Sid & Brad
